# Additional inspiration

Beyond Sergei Kozlov's philosophical miniatures (already in about.md):

- **"The Tao of Programming"** by Geoffrey James — programming wisdom in the form of parables and koans. Tales that don't argue; they present a situation where understanding either arrives or it doesn't.

- **ESR's "Unix Koans"** (e.g. "Master Foo Discourses on the Graphical User Interface") — the koan tradition applied to software culture. The master doesn't write a longer essay when the student doesn't understand. He drops you in a trashcan. The reader who gets it, gets it.

Both share a quality with the fairy tales: they sidestep the reader's existing habits and defenses. The idea arrives through the story door, not the argument door.
